        "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Configurability: The logging module allows you to configure the behavior of log messages dynamically. You can control the level of messages to be displayed or logged, change the output format, direct logs to different outputs (console, files, external services), and more. This configurability is helpful for different stages of development and for different deployment environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Log Levels: The logging module offers different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) that allow you to categorize messages based on their severity. This helps in understanding the nature of the message and prioritizing issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Granular Control: With logging, you can control the level of detail you want to see. During development and debugging, you might want to see detailed debug messages. In production, you can configure the system to only display important information or errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Persistence: Logging messages can be stored in files, databases, or sent to external logging services. This means that you can review and analyze logs even after the program has completed running. Print statements are temporary and vanish once the program execution is finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing and Maintenance: Logging statements can be left in the code and enable you to diagnose problems in a live environment without modifying the code. On the other hand, print() statements might need to be manually removed before deploying to production.\n",
        "\n",
        "Structured Information: Logging messages can be structured with various fields like timestamp, module name, line number, etc. This provides more context compared to plain print() statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separation of Concerns: Logging and program logic are separate concerns. This allows you to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.\n",

        "Performance: In some situations, print() statements might impact the performance of your program. Logging mechanisms can be optimized for performance.\n",

Breakpoints are a crucial tool for debugging and troubleshooting code, allowing developers to pinpoint issues and understand the flow of their program's execution."
